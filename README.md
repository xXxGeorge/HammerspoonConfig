# Hammerspoon Config

To save and share my hammerspoon config.

## Autochange

In order to jump to certain folders by pressing keys.

The functions that have been implemented are as follows:

- A → Applications
- B → Bin
- C → Content
- D → Desktop
- H → Home Directory
- L → Downloads
- P → Projects
- R → Reference

When you press Command + Shift + [Letter], the focus in Finder will jump directly to the corresponding folder. This setup is based on my personal keyboard configuration, where the Caps Lock key is remapped to act as  Command using Karabiner-Elements (for internal keyboards) or Via (for external keyboards).
